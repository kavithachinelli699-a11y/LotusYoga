                <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>Sonia is a yoga teacher and retreat facilitator originally from Spain, now based in Australia.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her journey into yoga and holistic practices led her to explore movement not only as a physical
                        practice, but as a way to build connection, presence and community.</p>
                    <p>After a transformative retreat experience in Bali, Sonia felt called to deepen her practice and
                        begin guiding others through yoga and conscious experiences. Back on the Gold Coast, she started
                        teaching yoga within her local and Latin community, gradually creating a growing and supportive
                        network of practitioners.</p>

                    <p>She is a <span class="fw-bold">500-hour RYT certified yoga teacher and holds a Certificate IV in
                            Yoga Teaching from
                            Byron Yoga Centre</span>, bringing a grounded, mindful and inclusive approach to her
                        classes.</span>

                    <p>At LotusYoga, Sonia’s focus is on holding space for people to move, breathe and reconnect — both
                        individually and as part of a community. Her work extends beyond the mat through workshops,
                        cacao ceremonies, retreats and holistic experiences designed to support personal growth and
                        connection.</p>
